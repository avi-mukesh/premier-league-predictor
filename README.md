# Predicting Outcomes of PL games

## Dataset
The data is the .csv files. Taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores credit to: DAVID CARIBOO). The data has been scraped from Transfermarkt.

## Setup
Notebook was run in SageMaker Studio using MXNet 1.9 Python 3.8 CPU Optimised kernel. Import so that AutoGluon works.
Otherwise, no setup required. Notebook cell to install AutoGluon is in the notebook.

Run every cell in notebook.ipynb from the start.

Data preprocessing will be performed, visualisations will be produced, models will be trained, and inference will be made at the end on a game in the future at the time of coding.

Uncommment/comment the prediction variables as desired to experiment with different attributes.
